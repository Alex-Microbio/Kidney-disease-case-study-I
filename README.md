# Chronic Kidney Disease Analysis

This notebook analyzes the Chronic Kidney Disease dataset using various machine learning techniques. Data was gathered from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Objective:
- Fetch and inspect the dataset
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables to numerical
- Train an XGBoost model:
    XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library.
- Evaluate model performance
- Use SHAP values, accuracy, ROC curve, AUC, and feature importance to interpret feature importance and interactions
- Explore correlation matrix for any interesting connections
- Disscussion and Conclusions
